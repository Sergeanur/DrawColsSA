 * On 16 October 1843 (a Monday) Hamilton was walking in along the Royal
 * Canal with his wife to preside at a Council meeting of the Royal Irish
 * Academy.
 * 
 * Although his wife talked to him now and again Hamilton hardly
 * heard, for the discovery of the quaternions, the first noncommutative
 * algebra to be studied, was taking shape in his mind:-
 * 
 *    "And here there dawned on me the notion that we must admit, in
 *     some sense, a fourth dimension of space for the purpose of calculating
 *     with triples ...  An electric circuit seemed to close, and a spark
 *     flashed forth."
